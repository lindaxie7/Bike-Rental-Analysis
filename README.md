## Summary
Is the ride on a weekday or weekend? 
Weekday, is rush-hour commute for the most part and probably from home to work. Weekend could be a longer, more casual ride and have higher variability.

Is the ride in the morning, afternoon, evening, or night?
Most likely in the evening 5:00PM to 6:00PM. The exact timing will be based on the difference in trip duration based on time of day. 

Is the user a customer or a subscribes?
Most likely a subscribe. 

Two additional visualizations suggestion for future analysis:
- We could include average duration for each trip based on: Trip and User Type. 

- We could also inclue What season is the most popular season for using citi bikes?
December — Feb. = Winter
March — May = Spring
June — Aug. = Summer
Sept. — Nov. = Fall
